Problem Selection
=================
I just picked the first three problems on the site since I didn't have a lot of free time this week to work on the solutions. I spent about four hours thinking about the problems, implementing the solutions and writing this document. The bulk of the time was spent familiarizing myself with the math.

General Methodology
===================

I limited myself to researching only the mathimaitcal formulas that would help me solve each problem. I purposly stayed away from links on popular sites (stackoverflow, etc..) that might have code hints. It felt good to solve the problems using algorithms that I had devised on my own.

Problem 1
=========

Problem one took me about 90 minutes due to me getting snagged on the fact that I was double counting the common multiples. when I summed the multiples individually. It took me a while to realize that the instructions said 3 -or- 5 and that I was counting the set of common mutltiples twice. Once I added code to subtract a set of common factors I ended up with the right answer.

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Problem 2
=========
This problem only took me about 30 minutes to figure out. After reading the problem description I thought it might be interesing to use push and shift to manipulate the array to simpify the iteration in the loop. It was fun to implement.

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Problem 3
=========
Problem three took me about 60 minutes to solve about half of the time was spent and understanding the math. I came up with the algorith after I read my second research source and read the 'How can I do it myself' section. I modeled the solution on working from the outside in.
